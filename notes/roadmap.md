### Step 1: **Set Up Global State with Context API**

Since the app has multiple interdependent entities (users, doctors, appointments), setting up global state using the `AppContext` will help in managing the data flow efficiently:

- Define a central `AppContext` to manage logged-in user info, selected doctor, and appointment data.
- Use context for authentication status and user type (doctor or patient).

### Step 2: **Create Basic API Functionality**

Implement the basic functionality in the `/api` folder for fetching data from the dummy datasets (`doctors.json`, `appointments.json`, `users.json`). This will allow me to:

- Develop early testing capabilities for the UI components.
- Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` to pre-fetch this data for your pages, adding the dynamic data layer.

### Step 3: **Build Core Components**

Start building core reusable components that are essential for user flows:

1. **DoctorCard.jsx**:

- This component will display individual doctor information when users perform a search.
- It will include doctor's name, specialty, availability, and an option to view more details or book an appointment.

2. **AppointmentForm.jsx**:

- This form will be used to collect the necessary information for booking an appointment.
- Include fields like name, appointment time, contact details, etc.

3. **Calendar.jsx**:

- Display a calendar view to allow users to pick a date and time for their appointment.
- It should be linked with the availability data to display free slots.

4. **Notification.jsx**:

- This component will handle success or error messages, such as "Appointment successfully booked" or "Error, please try again."

### Step 4: **Create User and Doctor Flows**

Once components are ready, start creating flows for:

1. **Doctor Search and Appointment Booking**:

- **Doctor Search Page** (doctor-search/page.js in /app):
  - UI Design: Design the search interface where users can filter by doctor specialty or name.
  - Fetch Doctors Data: Fetch the doctors' data from /api/doctors.js using getServerSideProps or useEffect on the client-side.
  - Display Doctors: Use the DoctorCard component to display each doctor.
- **Appointment Booking Page** (appointment-booking/page.js in /app):

  - Display the details of the selected doctor.
  - Render the AppointmentForm and Calendar components to allow users to book available time slots.

2. **User Dashboard**:
   Create a basic version of the user-dashboard/page.js:

   - Display Booked Appointments: Use a list to display the user's appointments.
   - Fetch Appointments: Fetch the user's appointments from /api/appointments.js and display them.
   - Cancel/Modify: Include options to modify or cancel existing appointments (start with just displaying appointments for the MVP).

3. **Doctor Dashboard**:
   Create the doctor-dashboard/page.js:

   - Manage Schedule: List all upcoming appointments.
   - Approve/Cancel Appointments: Allow doctors to approve or cancel appointments (for now, focus on just listing appointments).

### Step 5: **Style the Components**

Use the global stylesheet (`global.css`) or a modern UI framework like Tailwind CSS or Material UI to add a sleek, user-friendly interface. Make sure to:

- Add consistent styles across pages.
- Ensure responsive design for different device sizes.

### Step 6: **Authentication Flow**

Implement login and signup pages with basic validation (`validationUtils.js`). You can start with dummy authentication and later extend it to a proper service (e.g., Firebase).

### Suggested Order:

1. Set up **AppContext** and API routes.
2. Build **DoctorCard**, **AppointmentForm**, **Calendar**, and **Notification** components.
3. Create **doctor search** and **appointment booking** flows.
4. Develop the **user dashboard** and **doctor dashboard**.
5. Add authentication and finalize **login/signup** pages.
6. Style and refine the UI/UX.
